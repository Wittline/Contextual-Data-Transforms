# Contextual Data Transforms

<p align="justify"> 
This repository contain the most important contextual data transformation algorithms which help to improve the rate compression reached by statistical encoders, Modern compression tools and techniques are not based solely on the use of a data compression algorithm, actually the use of this is part of the final stage of an entire compression pipeline, but before reaching the last one, there is a stage called contextual transformations that are responsible for reorganizing the symbols of the data set so that they are more sensitive to statistical compression methods such as the Huffman algorithm, in other words they are artificial generators of redundancy, two of the main algorithms that will be explained in this repository are the BWT and the MTF.
